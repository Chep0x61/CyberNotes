### Byte :
The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits.
 
### Checksum :
A digit representing the sum of the correct digits in a piece of stored or transmitted digital data, against which later comparisons can be made to detect errors in the data.
 
### Ciphertext :
The altered form of a plaintext message so it is unreadable for anyone except the intended recipients. In other words, it has been turned into a secret.
 
### Classification :
Classification identifies the degree of harm to the organization, its stakeholders or others that might result if an information asset is divulged to an unauthorized person, process or organization. In short, classification is focused first and foremost on maintaining the confidentiality of the data, based on the data sensitivity.
 
### Classified or Sensitive Information :
Information that has been determined to require protection against unauthorized disclosure and is marked to indicate its classified status and classification level when in documentary form.
 
### Cloud Computing :
A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.
 
### Community Cloud :
A system in which the cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy and compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.
 
### Confidentiality :
The characteristic of data or information when it is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized persons or processes.
 
### Configuration Management :
A process and discipline used to ensure that the only changes made to a system are those that have been authorized and validated.
 
### Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED) :
An architectural approach to the design of buildings and spaces that emphasizes passive features to reduce the likelihood of criminal activity.
 
### Criticality :
A measure of the degree to which an organization depends on the information or information system for the success of a mission or of a business function.
 
### Cryptanalyst :
One who performs cryptanalysis, which is the study of mathematical techniques for attempting to defeat cryptographic techniques and/or information systems security. This includes the process of looking for errors or weaknesses in the implementation of an algorithm or of the algorithm itself.
 
### Cryptography :
The study or applications of methods to secure or protect the meaning and content of messages, files, or other information, usually by disguise, obscuration, or other transformations of that content and meaning.

### Data Integrity :
The property that data has not been altered in an unauthorized manner. Data integrity covers data in storage, during processing and while in transit.

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP) :
System capabilities designed to detect and prevent the unauthorized use and transmission of information.

### Decryption :
The reverse process from encryption. It is the process of converting a ciphertext message back into plaintext through the use of the cryptographic algorithm and the appropriate key for decryption (which is the same for symmetric encryption, but different for asymmetric encryption). This term is also used interchangeably with “deciphering.”

De-encapsulation :
The opposite process of encapsulation, in which bundles of data are unpacked or revealed.

Defense in Depth :
Information security strategy integrating people, technology, and operations capabilities to establish variable barriers across multiple layers and missions of the organization.

The prevention of authorized access to resources or the delaying of time-critical operations. (Time-critical may be milliseconds or it may be hours, depending upon the service provided.)

Digital Signature :
The result of a cryptographic transformation of data which, when properly implemented, provides the services of origin authentication, data integrity, and signer non-repudiation.

Disaster Recovery (DR) :
In information systems terms, the activities necessary to restore IT and communications services to an organization during and after an outage, disruption or disturbance of any kind or scale.

Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) :
The processes, policies and procedures related to preparing for recovery or continuation of an organization's critical business functions, technology infrastructure, systems and applications after the organization experiences a disaster. A disaster is when an organization’s critical business function(s) cannot be performed at an acceptable level within a predetermined period following a disruption.

Discretionary Access Control (DAC) :
A certain amount of access control is left to the discretion of the object’s owner, or anyone else who is authorized to control the object’s access. The owner can determine who should have access rights to an object and what those rights should be.

This acronym can be applied to three interrelated elements: a service, a physical server and a network protocol.

Egress Monitoring :
Monitoring of outgoing network traffic.

Encapsulation :
Enforcement of data hiding and code hiding during all phases of software development and operational use. Bundling together data and methods is the process of encapsulation; its opposite process may be called unpacking, revealing, or using other terms. Also used to refer to taking any set of data and packaging it or hiding it in another data structure, as is common in network protocols and encryption.

Encrypt :
To protect private information by putting it into a form that can only be read by people who have permission to do so.

Encryption :
The process and act of converting the message from its plaintext to ciphertext. Sometimes it is also referred to as enciphering. The two terms are sometimes used interchangeably in literature and have similar meanings.

Encryption System :
The total set of algorithms, processes, hardware, software and procedures that taken together provide an encryption and decryption capability.

Event :
Any observable occurrence in a network or system.

Exploit :
